# Nius App

Nius App is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) that consumes [News API](https://newsapi.org/) data.

- 2017: I have created this app as my first React app, developed to learn the basis of React.
- 2020: I have refactored this app with functional components and hooks, to update my skills with React.

You can see this project in action here: [https://luciano-im.github.io/nius/](https://luciano-im.github.io/nius/)
